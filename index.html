    <h2>What is Flexbox</h2>

    <p>
      The CSS Flexible Box Module or simply known as Flexbox is a
      one-dimensional layout model
    </p>

    <p>
      It allows you to design felixble and efficient layouts, align and
      distribute space among items in a container
    </p>

    <p>Flexbox helps you arrange elements in a webpage with ease.</p>

    <p>
      Flexbox provides a lot of flexibility to arrange items, adjust spacing,
      adjsut alignment, and adjust the order of items.
    </p>

    <p>Before flexbox, there were four layout modes.</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Block, for sections in a webpage</li>
      <li>Inline, for text</li>
      <li>Table, for two-dimensional table data</li>
      <li>Positioned, for explicit position of an element</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Terminology</h2>

    <p>
      When we talk about flexbox, we mainly have two entities, a parent
      container, which we refer to as flex-container and the immediately
      children, which we refer to as flex-elements. Flex items are contained
      within the flex container.
    </p>

    <img
      src="./images/flexbox-container-and-items.jpg"
      height="300px"
      width="600px"
      alt="flexbox containers and items"
    />

    <h2>Flex Axes</h2>

    <img
      src="./images/flexbox-axes.jpg"
      height="350px"
      width="600px"
      alt="flexbox axes"
    />

    <p>You deal with two axes with flexbox:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>Main Axis</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Runs left to right by default</p>
            <ul>
              <li>The startpoint of the main axis is termed Main Start</li>
              <li>The endpoint of the main axis is termed Main End</li>
              <li>
                The length from main start to main end is called the Main Size.
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Flex items flow from main start to main end and take up the
                  main size as the length
                </p>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Cross Axis</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Runs top to bottom by default
            <ul>
              <li>The startpoint of the main axis is termed Cross Start</li>
              <li>The endpoint of the main axis is termed Cross End</li>
              <li>
                The length from main start to main end is called the Cross Size.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      You can change the direction of the main and cross axes by changing how
      the items are laid out in the container.
    </p>

    <h2>Flex Container Properties</h2>

    <p>There are ten total flex container properties</p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        Display - this is what defines a flex container and is mandatory in
        order to work with flexbox.
      </li>
      <li>
        flex-direction - it defines the direction in which the flex items are
        placed within the container
      </li>
      <li>
        flex-wrap - used to control the wrapping of items within the container
      </li>
      <li>
        flex-flow - shorthand for the combination of flex-direction and
        flex-wrap
      </li>
      <li>column-gap - sets the gap between columns</li>
      <li>row-gap - sets the gap between rows</li>
      <li>gap - shorthand for setting gap between column and rows</li>
      <li>
        justify-content - defines the alignment of the items along the main axis
      </li>
      <li>
        align-items - defines how flex-items are laid out along the cross axis
      </li>
      <li>
        align-content - similar to justify-content, but this will align along
        the cross axis and not the main axis. This works ony when there are
        multiple flex rows within the container.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <hr />

    <h3>display</h3>

    <p>
      Display creates either a block level or and inline container. The possible
      values are &#39;display: flex&#39; or &#39;display: inline-flex&#39;
    </p>

    <p>On the container class, we set the display: flex;</p>

    <p>
      As with all properties with CSS, some initial values are defined. When
      creating a flex container, all of the contained flex items behave in a
      certain way.
    </p>

    <p>First, they will display in a row.</p>

    <p>
      Second, items start from the beginning of the left axis, the left most
      axis, but do not stretch to the end. However, they can shrink to a certain
      extent
    </p>

    <p>
      Third, items will stretch to fill the cross axis, from the top to the
      bottom.
    </p>

    <p>
      Also, from the border, the container itself has 100% width, so it does
      behave similar to a block level element. If you do not want a block level
      flex container, you can set the flex proeprty to inline-flex and create an
      inline flex container.
    </p>

    <p>
      After setting the property to inline-flex, the border wraps around the
      container instead of filling the full width to accomodate its children.
    </p>

    <h3>flex-direction</h3>

    <p>
      Flex Direction establsihes the main axis, which in turn decides how the
      flex items are placed within the container.
    </p>

    <p>
      By default, the main access flows from left to right, which is the reason
      why the initial items are placed from left to right in the browser.
    </p>

    <p>
      By changing the direction of the flex property, we can change the order of
      the flex items displayed
    </p>

    <p>There are four possible values for flex-direction:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        flex-direction: row; - This is the default value. Items flow from left
        to right
      </li>
      <li>
        flex-direction: row-reverse; - Sets the row items in a row, reversed.
      </li>
      <li>
        flex-direction: column; - Sets the main access from top to bottom. The
        items will be stacked on top of each other.
      </li>
      <li>
        flex-direction: column-reverse - stacks items in a column in the reverse
        order.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>flex-wrap</h3>

    <p>There are three possible valus for flex-wrap</p>

    <ol>
      <li>flex-wrap: nowrap; - This is the default value.</li>
      <li>
        flex-wrap: wrap; - The values of the container will wrap/unwrap as you
        decrease/increase the viewport size. Wrapping takes place only when
        needed.
      </li>
      <li>
        flex-wrap: wrap-reverse; - Instead of items falling into the row below,
        they climb from the end up into the row above.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      Vertical wrapping of items is also possible. For that, we need to change
      flex-direction to column and add a height to the flex container.
    </p>

    <h3>flex-flow</h3>

    <p>
      Flex flow is a short hand for both flex-direction and flex-wrap. The first
      value is the flex-direction and the second direction is the flex-wrap.
    </p>

    <p>ie. flex-flow: &#39;flex-direction&#39;&#39;flex-wrap&#39;;</p>

    <p>
      By default, the flex-flow is set to row and nowrap, which are the default
      values of each of the indvidual properties.
    </p>

    <p>
      You can type any possible combination of the direction and wrap values and
      the container will adjust.
    </p>

    <h3>column-gap</h3>

    <p>Sets the gap between columns.</p>

    <p>Values can be a non-negative value or a percentage.</p>

    <p>ex. column-gap: 20px;</p>

    <p>gives a gap of 20px to the columns.</p>

    <h3>row-gap</h3>

    <p>Sets the gap between rows.</p>

    <p>Values can be a non-negative value or a percentage.</p>

    <p>ex. row-gap: 20px;</p>

    <p>gives a gap of 20px to the rows.</p>

    <h3>gap</h3>

    <p>
      Gap is shorthad for row-gap and column-gap. The first value is row-gap and
      the second value is column-gap.
    </p>

    <p>ie. gap: &#39;row-gap&#39;&#39;column-gap&#39;</p>

    <p>Values can be a non-negative value or a percentage.</p>

    <p>
      You can type any possible combination of the row and column gap values and
      the container will adjust.
    </p>

    <h2>Aligment-Based Properties</h2>

    <h3>justify-content</h3>

    <p>
      Defines the content along the main axis. Used to align items and
      distribute any extra spacing in the parent container.
    </p>

    <p>Possible Values:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        justify-content: flex-start; - By default, justify-content is set to the
        value flex-start, which places the flex items at the beginning of the
        main axis, which is also knonw as &#39;main start&#39;.
      </li>
      <li>
        justify-content: flex-end; - Causes the flex items to be placed at the
        end of the main axis, which is also known as &#39;main end&#39;
      </li>
      <li>
        justify-content: center; - Causes the flex items to be placed at the
        cneter of the main axis.
      </li>
      <li>
        justify-content: space-between; - evenly distributes the extra space
        within the container between the flex items.
      </li>
      <li>
        justify-content: space-around; - evenly distributes the extra space
        within the container between the flex items and gives a space that is
        half of the space that&#39;s between the items to the start and end.
      </li>
      <li>
        justify-content: space-evenly; - even distributes the extra space within
        the container between the flex items and gives equal space to the start
        and end.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>align-items</h3>

    <p>
      Align Items defines the default behavior for how flex items are laid out
      across the cross axis of the container. It works just like
      justify-content, but in the perpendicular position.
    </p>

    <p>To visualize the changes, you need a height on the container.</p>

    <p>Possible Values:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        align-items: stretch; - By default, the value of align-items is stretch.
        This means that items stretch the entire length of the cross axis.
      </li>
      <li>
        align-items: flex-start; - All items will be pushed to the cross start,
        which is the starting point of the cross axis.
      </li>
      <li>
        align-itens: flex-end; - All items will be pushed to the botto of the
        container, which is the cross end, the ending point of the cross axis.
      </li>
      <li>
        align-items: center; - Places the items at the center of the cross axis.
      </li>
      <li>align-items: baseline; - The baseline upon which content sits.</li>
    </ol>

    <img
      src="images/baseline.jpg"
      alt="baseline"
      height="350px"
      width="600px"
    />

    <h3>align-content</h3>

    <p>
      The align content propety aligns lines of content along the cross axis,
      similar to how justify-content justifies content along the main axis.
    </p>

    <p>
      A very important condition is that multiple lines or rows must exist
      within the container, otherwise the property doesn&#39;t have any effect.
    </p>

    <p>
      First, make sure to have a height on the container and also enable
      wrapping of items.
    </p>

    <p>Possible Values:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        align-content: stretch; - By default, the value of align-content is
        stretch.
      </li>
      <li>
        align-content: flex-start; - This pulls the rows to the beginning of the
        cross axis.
      </li>
      <li>
        align-content: flex-end; - Pushes the content to the end of the cross
        axis.
      </li>
      <li>align-content: center; - Center aligns the content</li>
      <li>
        align-content: space-between: - Distributes vertical space between rows
      </li>
      <li>
        align-content: space-around: - distributes the space around the lines.
        The center portion has twice the amount of space as the top and bottom
        edges.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Flex Item Properties</h2>

    <ol>
      <li>
        order - controls the order in which the items appear in the flex
        container
      </li>
      <li>
        flex-grow - defines the ability for a flex item to grow if necessary
      </li>
      <li>
        flex-shrink - defines the ability for a flex item to shrink if necessary
      </li>
      <li>flex-basis - specififes the initial main size of a flex item</li>
      <li>flex - shorthand for flex-grow, flex-shrink and flex-basis</li>
      <li>align-align</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>order</h3>

    <p>
      Order is an integer value used to determine the order in which items
      appear.
    </p>

    <p>
      By default, the order of all flex items is 0. You can change the order in
      which items appear on screen by using &#39;order: number&#39;, ie.
      &#39;order: 1&#39;, &#39;order: 2&#39;, etc.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you specify the same order number for two or more items, the items will
      appear in the order in which they appear in the source code.
    </p>

    <h3>flex-grow</h3>

    <p>
      Flex-grow specificies what amount of space inside a container the item
      should take up if necessary. It is always relative to the other children
      within the flex container.
    </p>

    <p>
      By default, all flex iems have a value of 0 and only take up the amount of
      space required to fit the content.
    </p>

    <p>
      ex. &#39;flex-grow: 0;&#39;, &#39;flex-grow: 1;&#39;. &#39;flex-grow:
      3;&#39; etc.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you want all of te items to grow to take up the extra space evenly, you
      simply add flex-grow: 1 for all items.
    </p>

    <h3>flex-shrink</h3>

    <p>
      Flex shrink defines the ability for a flex item t shrink if necessary.
    </p>

    <p>
      Unlike flex-grow, the default value for flex-shrink is 1 on every item.
    </p>

    <h3>flex-basis</h3>

    <p>
      Specificies the inital size of a flex item before the extra space in the
      container is distributed. This is used in place of the width property in
      flex layouts.
    </p>

    <p>
      It can accept values such as: pixels, percentages, values, rem, or even
      keywords like auto.
    </p>

    <p>By default, flex-basis has a value of auto.</p>

    <p>flex-grow and flex-shrink apply on top of flex-basis.</p>

    <p>
      For example, if you set flex-grow: 1 on item 1, the extra space is added
      on top of the 200 px.
    </p>

    <p>
      Flex-box doesn&#39;t try to decrease its growth just because it is larger
      than the other items to begin with.
    </p>

    <h3>flex</h3>

    <p>Flex is shorthand for flex-grow, flex-shrink, and flex-basis.</p>

    <p>
      Although you can designate grow, shrink and basis individually, Flex is
      the recommended method.
    </p>

    <p>
      By default, flex has a value of &#39;flex: 0 1 auto;&#39;, meaning the
      items will no grow to fit the container, the items will shrink if
      necessary, and that the width of the items depends on the content.
    </p>

    <p>
      The flex property can be specified using one, two or three of the values.
    </p>

    <p>ie. .item{ flex-grow: 2; flex-shrink: 5; flex-basis: 200; }</p>

    <p>You can shorthand the above by using:</p>

    <p>.item { flex: 2 5 200px; }</p>

    <p>Other examples:</p>

    <p>
      flex: 2; flex: 10em; flex: 30px; flex: 1 30px; flex: 2 2; flex: 2 2 10%;
      etc...
    </p>

    <h3>align-self</h3>

    <p>Used to control the alignment of individual items.</p>

    <p>The default value for align-self is auto.</p>

    <p>
      Align-self is computed off of the align-items property of the parent
      container. align-self overides the align-items value fo the flex
      container.
    </p>

    <p>The values are pretty much the same as the values for align-items.</p>

    <p>
      align-self: flex-start; - the item will be pushed to the beginning of the
      cross axis align-self: flex-end; - the item will be pushed to the end of
      the cross axis align-self: center; - the item will be centered within the
      cross axis. align-self: stretch; - The item will be stretch across the
      cross axis.
